== Contested deletion ==

This page is not unambiguously promotional, because I am trying to create a similar article to [[Coca-Cola]] or [[Red Bull]]. A healthy, high quality version. I'm just trying out Wikipedia, I'm fascinated about startups and I like their products. So I'm writing about them. Others prefer the unhealthy brands and write about those instead. It's an incredible, new, tiny company with healthy, high quality products and I don't quite understand why you aren't rather deleting the unhealthy brands. – Because they're bigger? – Again: I'm just fascinated about startups. No one is paying me. <!-- Template:Unsigned --><small class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:KorneliaStoiber|KorneliaStoiber]] ([[User talk:KorneliaStoiber#top|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/KorneliaStoiber|contribs]]) 00:45, 6 Oct 2024 (UTC)</small>
:{{re|KorneliaStoiber}} The tone of the text was unacceptably promotional; it felt like it could have been lifted from the company's website. I have rewritten it with a more neutral tone. —'''[[User:C.Fred|C.Fred]]''' ([[User_talk:C.Fred|talk]]) 00:49, 6 October 2024 (UTC)

:Thank you very much. I'll try to choose more neutral formulations in the future. [[User:KorneliaStoiber|KorneliaStoiber]] ([[User talk:KorneliaStoiber|talk]]) 01:14, 6 October 2024 (UTC)
