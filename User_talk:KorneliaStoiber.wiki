{{Quote box|quote=<p>If this is the first article that you have created, you may want to read [[WP:Your first article|the guide to writing your first article]].</p><p>You may want to consider using the [[Wikipedia:Article wizard|Article Wizard]] to help you create articles.</p>|width=20%|align=right}}
A tag has been placed on [[:Draft:Wonderful Drinks]], requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#G11|section G11 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because the page seems to be unambiguous advertising which only promotes a company, group, product, service, person, or point of view and would need to be fundamentally rewritten in order to become encyclopedic. Please read [[Wikipedia:Spam|the guidelines on spam]] and [[Wikipedia:FAQ/Organizations]] for more information. 

If you think this page should not be deleted for this reason, you may '''contest the nomination''' by [[:Draft:Wonderful Drinks|visiting the page]] and clicking the button labelled "Contest this speedy deletion". This will give you the opportunity to explain why you believe the page should not be deleted. However, be aware that once a page is tagged for speedy deletion, it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag from the page yourself, but do not hesitate to add information in line with [[Wikipedia:List of policies|Wikipedia's policies and guidelines]]. If the page is deleted, and you wish to retrieve the deleted material for future reference or improvement, then please contact the {{Querylink|Special:Log|qs=type=delete&page=Draft%3AWonderful+Drinks|deleting administrator}}. <!-- Template:Db-spam-notice --> <!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --> [[User:FifthFive|FifthFive]] ([[User talk:FifthFive|talk]]) 23:45, 5 October 2024 (UTC)

== October 2024 ==

[[File:Information.svg|left|25px|alt=Information icon]] Hello KorneliaStoiber. The nature of your edits gives the impression you have an undisclosed financial stake in promoting a topic, but you have not complied with Wikipedia's [[Wikipedia:Paid-contribution disclosure|mandatory paid editing disclosure requirements]]. Paid advocacy is a category of [[Wikipedia:Conflict of interest|conflict of interest]] (COI) editing that involves being employed (or being compensated in any way) by a person, group, company or organization to promote their interests. '''Paid advocacy on Wikipedia must be disclosed even if you have not specifically been asked to edit Wikipedia.''' Undisclosed paid advocacy is prohibited by our policies on [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view|neutral point of view]] and what [[Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not|Wikipedia is not]], and is an especially serious type of COI; the [[Wikimedia Foundation]] regards it as a "black hat" practice akin to [[Spamdexing|black-hat search-engine optimization]].

Paid advocates are strongly discouraged from direct article editing, and should instead propose changes on the [[Help:Talk pages|talk page]] of the article in question if an article exists. If the article does not exist, paid advocates are strongly discouraged from attempting to write an article at all. At best, any proposed article creation should be submitted through the [[Wikipedia:Articles for creation|articles for creation]] process, rather than directly.

Regardless, if you are receiving or expect to receive compensation for your edits, broadly construed, you are '''<u>required</u> by the [[wmf:TOU#paid-contrib-disclosure|Wikimedia Terms of Use]] to disclose your employer, client and affiliation.''' You can post such a mandatory disclosure to your user page at [[User:KorneliaStoiber]]. The template {{tl|Paid}} can be used for this purpose â€“ e.g. in the form: {{tlc|paid|2=user=KorneliaStoiber|3=employer=<var>InsertName</var>|4=client=<var>InsertName</var>}}. If I am mistaken â€“ you are not being directly or indirectly compensated for your edits â€“ please state that in response to this message. Otherwise, please provide the required disclosure. In either case, '''do not edit further''' until you answer this message. <!-- Template:Uw-paid1 --> [[User:Seraphimblade|Seraphimblade]] <small><sup>[[User talk:Seraphimblade|Talk to me]]</sup></small> 00:01, 6 October 2024 (UTC)

:This page is not unambiguously promotional, because I am trying to create a similar article to [[Coca-Cola]] or [[Red Bull]]. A healthy, high quality version. I'm just trying out Wikipedia, I'm fascinated about startups and I like their products. So I'm writing about them. Others prefer the unhealthy brands and write about those instead. It's an incredible, new, tiny company with healthy, high quality products and I don't quite understand why you aren't rather deleting the unhealthy brands. â€“ Because they're bigger? â€“ Again: I'm just fascinated about startups. No one is paying me. [[User:KorneliaStoiber|KorneliaStoiber]] ([[User talk:KorneliaStoiber#top|talk]]) 00:28, 6 October 2024 (UTC)
::As to why it was deleted? [[WP:SOAP|Wikipedia does not permit advertising or promotion]], and that includes via any type of marketese language or "talking up". As some examples, but not an exhaustive list: {{tq|that strives to make the world an even more wonderful place}} (flowery language, and don't care what they "strive" to do, we'd care what [[WP:RS|reliable]] and [[WP:IS|independent]] sources confirm they've actually ''done''), {{tq|Respect and love for their base product have brought them together and they ''personally select'' and purchase ''all ingredients''.}} (flowery language again, and leave out the emphasis, also needs to be sourced), {{tq|As fresh as possible, organic, never from concentrate, and without flavourings or syrup for a purely natural taste.}} (straight out of an ad) {{tq|That's why all fruit is ''juiced whole in the peel'', the source of an abundance of vitamins!}} (again, cut the emphasis, flowery language, and do not use exclamation marks), and it just goes on and on like that. Skip the flowery language, and just stick to [[WP:NPOV|neutrally]] stating facts confirmed by reliable and independent sources. If there is not a substantial quantity of reliable and independent source material about something (and there isn't about the majority of companies), it is not [[WP:NCORP|notable]] and so it wouldn't be appropriate to have an article about it at all. That article read like an ad brochure. [[User:Seraphimblade|Seraphimblade]] <small><sup>[[User talk:Seraphimblade|Talk to me]]</sup></small> 01:13, 6 October 2024 (UTC)
:::Thank you very much. I understand your point and I'll try to write more neutral in the future. Moreover, I'll add many more references from across the web, emphasising reliable news sources in particular.
